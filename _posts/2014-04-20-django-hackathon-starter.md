The other day, I ran into the Node.js [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter
).

Some people may argue against such projects because covering all the bases invariably introduces some cruft in the code base.

Such criticism however, conveniently ignores the title of the project. A Hackathon Starter - by definition - is not designed to be a finished article.

>  **Starter** *noun*: “an automatic device for starting a machine, esp. the engine of a vehicle.”

Lets cut to the chase. In my opinion, following is a list of must-haves in a  hackathon starter package for Django:

* Theme-able, Responsive and Pain-free front-end scaffolding - [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Comprehensive web analytics for tracking key metrics - [Google Analytics](www.google.com/analytics/)
* Local as well as Oauth authentication and account management - [OneAll](www.oneall.com/)
* Admin interface for housekeeping tasks - [django-admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/)
* Asset pipeline for packaging and compressing static files - [django-pipeline](https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline)
* Deployment scripts for various hosting services - [django-herokuapp](https://github.com/etianen/django-herokuapp)
* Integration with payment processors - [lightening fast shop](www.getlfs.com/)
* API examples for popular services - [OneAll](www.oneall.com/)
* A blog with social integration - [Syte](rigoneri.github.io/syte/)
* Test automation - [Proofread](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/django-proofread)

Naturally, the list above is not the last word on hackathon automation. I will be editing it as I think through this.
