The other day, I ran into the Node.js Hackathon Starter.

Some people may argue against such projects because covering all the bases invariably introduces some cruft in the code base.

Such criticism however, conveniently ignores the title of the project. A Hackathon Starter - by definition - is not designed to be a finished article.


  Starter noun: “an automatic device for starting a machine, esp. the engine of a vehicle.”


Lets cut to the chase. In my opinion, following is a list of must-haves in a  hackathon starter package for Django:

Theme-able, Responsive and Pain-free front-end scaffolding - Twitter Bootstrap
Comprehensive web analytics for tracking key metrics - Google Analytics
Local as well as Oauth authentication and account management - OneAll
Admin interface for housekeeping tasks - django-admin
Asset pipeline for packaging and compressing static files - django-pipeline
Deployment scripts for various hosting services - django-herokuapp
Integration with payment processors - lightening fast shop
API examples for popular services - OneAll
A blog with social integration - Syte
Test automation - Proofread
Naturally, the list above is not the last word on hackathon automation. I will be editing it as I think through this.
