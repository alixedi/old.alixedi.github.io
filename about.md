My name is Ali Zaidi. I am a full-stack developer.

Currently, I am running a company called [Bitswits](www.bitswits.com). Bitswits makes cloud computing apps for telcos using a tech-stack that includes FreeBSD, Python and Django.

I like minimalism, legos, python and books. I do not like ties, meetings, javascript and touch-screen phones.
